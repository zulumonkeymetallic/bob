## ðŸŽ¯ **BOB's Data Model**

### Hierarchy
```
Goal (Personal only)
â”œâ”€â”€ Story 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task 2  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Task 3
â””â”€â”€ Story 2
    â”œâ”€â”€ Task 4
    â””â”€â”€ Task 5

Work Project
â”œâ”€â”€ Task A
â”œâ”€â”€ Task B
â””â”€â”€ Task C
```

### Key Rules
1. **Goals** are personal only (Health, Growth, Wealth, Tribe, Home)
2. **Work Projects** don't link to goals
3. **Stories** can't be completed until all tasks are done
4. **Tasks** sync to iOS Reminders (separate Personal/Work lists)
5. **Personas** keep Personal and Work completely separate

## ðŸ¤– **AI Planning System**

Navigate to **AI Planner** to:
1. Let AI analyze your tasks and goals
2. Generate calendar blocks for optimal scheduling  
3. Respect your wake/sleep times and preferences
4. Balance weekly theme targets (Health, Growth, etc.)
5. Automatically sync to Google Calendar

**Prerequisites for AI Planning:**
- Add some tasks/goals first
- Set up planning preferences (wake/sleep times)
- Connect Google Calendar (optional but recommended)

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

### "Cannot save stories/tasks"
- Make sure you're signed in
- Check your persona (Personal vs Work) in the header
- For stories: Link them to a goal first

### "Planning doesn't work"  
- Add at least 2-3 tasks first
- Set up planning preferences
- Check browser console for errors

### "Import failed"
- Verify CSV format matches templates exactly
- Check for special characters in data
- Try smaller batches (10-20 items at a time)

## ðŸ“± **Navigation**

- **Dashboard** - Overview and stats
- **Stories** - Kanban board (Personal only)  
- **Tasks** - Task list (both Personal/Work)
- **AI Planner** - Calendar planning system
- **Goals** - Goal management (Personal only)
- **Admin** - Bulk operations and settings

## ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tips**

1. **Start Small** - Use templates first, then customize
2. **Use Themes** - Categorize everything for better AI planning
3. **Set Estimates** - Helps with calendar planning
4. **Link Everything** - Tasks â†’ Stories â†’ Goals for progress tracking
5. **Regular Reviews** - Check progress weekly and adjust
