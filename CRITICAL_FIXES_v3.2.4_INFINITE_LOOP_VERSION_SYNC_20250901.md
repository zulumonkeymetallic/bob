# BOB v3.2.4 - Critical Production Fixes Summary

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Issues Resolved**

### âœ… **1. Infinite Activity Tracking Loop** 
**Problem:** Console flooding with 900+ activity logs per minute  
**Cause:** `useEffect` in GlobalSidebar triggering on every render  
**Fix:** Added proper dependency array `[selectedItem?.id, selectedType, currentUser?.uid]`

### âœ… **2. Version Number Mismatch**
**Problem:** Console showing `BOB v3.1.0` while deployed version was `v3.2.4`  
**Cause:** Hardcoded version strings not updated  
**Fix:** Updated all version references to `v3.2.4` across codebase

### âœ… **3. Package.json Version Sync**
**Problem:** Package.json showing version `3.1.3`  
**Fix:** Updated to `3.2.4` to match deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ **Enhanced Goal Card View Feature**

### **Feature Status: âœ… ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**
The goal card view already includes the requested functionality:

**When clicking on a goal card:**
1. **Stories Table Expands** - Shows ModernStoriesTable underneath the goal
2. **Add Story Button** - Green "Add Story" button in the expanded section  
3. **Full CRUD Operations** - Edit, delete, and manage stories directly
4. **Modern Table Format** - Same consistent interface as other tables
5. **Goal Context** - Stories are automatically linked to the clicked goal

**Implementation Details:**
- `GoalsCardView.tsx` - Card click handler toggles expansion
- `ModernStoriesTable` - Embedded in expanded section
- Story management functions - Full CRUD with real-time updates
- Theme color coordination - Stories inherit goal theme colors

### **How to Use:**
1. Navigate to Goals â†’ Card View
2. Click any goal card (not the dropdown menu)
3. Stories table appears below with "Add Story" button
4. Click "Add Story" to create new stories linked to that goal
5. Use inline editing to modify stories directly in the table
