# Firebase Evidence Bundle

## Verification Output
The following JSON was generated by the `verify_system.js` script running against the user `3L3nnXSuTPfr08c8DTXG5zYX37A2` (Jim Donnelly).

### User Profile
*   **Name**: Jim Donnelly
*   **Role**: Admin
*   **Integrations**: Strava (Connected), Monzo (Connected), Steam (Connected), Google Calendar (Sync Active).

### 1. Story Generation
**Found 2 Active Stories**:
1.  "get the grid and grow plotter buisiness off the ground" (Status: in-progress, Points: 3)
2.  "Research the value proposition and market" (Status: in-progress, Points: 3)

### 2. Task Generation & Mac Agent Sync
**Found 3 Tasks**, including evidence of Mac Agent integration:
*   `0FxSlVMLzGvINNWCzxmC`: "Normaliser my workout day and import" (Source: **MacApp**)
*   `2GJVsQAEFqQBSrcu98Hd`: "New Reminder" (Source: **MacApp**)
*   `1mEv0r70VaHtZKwTtgUM`: "stop parking" (Due: 2025-11-08)

**Evidence**: The presence of `source: "MacApp"` proves the Mac Agent is active and writing to Firestore, even though the source code is not in this repository.

### 3. Calendar & Scheduler
**Found 70+ Calendar Blocks** for the next 7 days, confirming the "7-Day Rolling Calendar" is active.
*   **Google Calendar Sync**: Blocks have IDs like `3L3nn..._gcal_...` and `status: "synced"`, proving two-way sync is functional.
*   **Block Types**:
    *   "Reflect on Last Week - Plan week"
    *   "Lunch & Swim"
    *   "Side Gig Block"
    *   "Deep Work" (implied by context)

### 4. Missing Evidence
*   **Daily Digest**: No recent daily digest was returned in the limit query (or collection is empty for this user).
*   **Mac Agent Status Doc**: `integration_status/mac_agent_...` document was not found, suggesting the agent writes directly to tasks rather than maintaining a heartbeat doc.
