"""
Monkey patches for making hermes-agent tools work inside async frameworks (Atropos).

Problem:
    Some tools use asyncio.run() internally (e.g., mini-swe-agent's Modal backend,
    web_extract). This crashes when called from inside Atropos's event loop because
    asyncio.run() can't be nested.

Solution:
    Replace the problematic methods with versions that use a dedicated background
    thread with its own event loop. The calling code sees the same sync interface --
    call a function, get a result -- but internally the async work happens on a
    separate thread that doesn't conflict with Atropos's loop.

    These patches are safe for normal CLI use too: when there's no running event
    loop, the behavior is identical (the background thread approach works regardless).

What gets patched:
    - SwerexModalEnvironment.__init__ -- creates Modal deployment on a background thread
    - SwerexModalEnvironment.execute -- runs commands on the same background thread
    - SwerexModalEnvironment.stop -- stops deployment on the background thread

Usage:
    Call apply_patches() once at import time (done automatically by hermes_base_env.py).
    This is idempotent -- calling it multiple times is safe.
