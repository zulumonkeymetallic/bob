# BOB v3.2.3 - Static Method Context Fix Deployment Success

## üéØ DEPLOYMENT SUMMARY
**Version:** v3.2.3  
**Date:** September 1, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL  
**Build Time:** ~2 minutes  
**Bundle Size:** 445.71 kB (gzipped) - consistent performance  

## üîß CRITICAL FIX IMPLEMENTED

### Static Method Context Error Resolution
- **Problem:** `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.migrateGoalStatus')`
- **Root Cause:** Static method `this` context binding issues in JavaScript runtime
- **Solution:** Explicit class name references for all static method calls

### Technical Resolution
```typescript
// Before (causing context errors)
static migrateGoal(goal: any): any {
  migrated.status = this.migrateGoalStatus(goal.status);
}

// After (explicit class references)
static migrateGoal(goal: any): any {
  migrated.status = ChoiceMigration.migrateGoalStatus(goal.status);
}
```
