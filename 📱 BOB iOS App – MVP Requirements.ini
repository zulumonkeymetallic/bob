Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 2025‑09‑03
Goal: To build a functional iOS app that complements the BOB web app, enabling mobile access to core features, reminders integration, and HealthKit data syncing.

⸻

🧱 1. Core Architecture
	•	Language: Swift (SwiftUI preferred)
	•	Architecture Pattern: MVVM
	•	State Management: Combine or SwiftData
	•	Backend Integration: Firebase SDK (Firestore, Auth, Functions, Analytics)
	•	Local Storage: UserDefaults (for caching simple flags), CoreData optional

⸻

🔐 2. Authentication
	•	Use Firebase Authentication (email/password)
	•	Optional: Sign in with Apple and Google (future enhancement)

⸻

🗂️ 3. Features

✅ 3.1. Reminders Sync (2-way)

	•	Export tasks from Firestore into Reminders
	•	Background sync via Siri Shortcuts or background tasks
	•	Syncable fields: Title, Due Date, Notes, Priority

✅ 3.2. Goals / Stories / Tasks Interface
	•	List and detail views for:
	•	Goals
	•	Stories (linked to goals)
	•	Tasks (linked to stories)
	•	Add/Edit/Delete for all 3 object types
	•	Create Task from FAB or Siri Shortcut
	•	Inline linking: e.g., Task created under a Story shows parent context

✅ 3.3. Habit Tracker
	•	Display daily habits checklist
	•	Tap to mark as complete
	•	Sync state to Firebase
	•	Log streaks and completions to Firestore

✅ 3.4. HealthKit Integration
	•	Read-only access to:
	•	VO₂ Max
	•	Resting Heart Rate
	•	Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
	•	Step count
	•	Screen time (if allowed via Screen Time API)
	•	Sync these metrics daily to Firebase under /user_metrics/{uid}/YYYY-MM-DD

✅ 3.5. Chat Interface
	•	Simple GPT-based conversational interface for:
	•	Daily reflection
	•	Adding tasks via voice
	•	Habit check-ins
	•	Store journal entries to Firestore

✅ 3.6. Calendar View (Read-only MVP)
	•	Display Firestore-synced calendar events (via Google Calendar or Firestore mirror)
	•	Show goals/tasks inline on calendar blocks (e.g., Story task at 10 AM)

✅ 3.7. Watch App (Barebones MVP)
	•	Show current day’s top 3 priorities (Goal → Story → Task)
	•	Single tap to mark task complete
	•	Siri Shortcut to “speak to BOB”

⸻

🎨 4. UI Requirements
	•	Design System: Match BOB Web (Tailwind look) – clean, minimalist
	•	Navigation: Tab bar with:
	•	Home (daily view)
	•	Goals
	•	Tasks
	•	Chat
	•	Profile/settings
	•	Dark Mode: Support required

	•	Sync flags per record (isSynced, lastUpdated)
	•	Conflict resolution: server-wins

⸻

🧪 6. Testing Requirements
	•	Unit tests for:
	•	Task creation
	•	Reminder sync
	•	HealthKit import
	•	UI tests for:
	•	FAB flow
	•	Navigation
	•	Mocks for Firebase and HealthKit (for local dev)

⸻

📦 7. Deliverables
	•	Swift project source code
	•	.plist file with Firebase config
	•	README with build/run instructions
	•	Initial TestFlight build
	•	Postman collection or Curl samples for interacting with backend (optional)

⸻

🧠 8. Stretch Goals / Phase 2
	•	Push Notifications for:
	•	Daily habit prompt
	•	Task reminders
