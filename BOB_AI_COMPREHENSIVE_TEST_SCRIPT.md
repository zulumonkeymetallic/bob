# BOB Platform - Comprehensive AI Testing Script

## Overview
This test script provides comprehensive instructions for AI agents to test all implemented features of the BOB productivity platform. The script covers authentication, CRUD operations, UI interactions, and data integrity verification.

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Access to BOB application: https://bob20250810.web.app
- Side door authentication configured for AI testing
- Modern web browser with developer tools enabled

### Test User Credentials
```
Standard URL: https://bob20250810.web.app
Test Mode URL: https://bob20250810.web.app?test-login=ai-agent-token&test-mode=true
Test User: AI Test Agent (ai-test-agent@bob.local)
Persona: Personal (default)
```

### Side Door Authentication Setup
**Important for AI Testing**: The side door authentication allows AI agents to bypass OAuth and test all features without Google account limitations.

**How to Use Side Door Access**:
1. Navigate to the test URL with parameters: `https://bob20250810.web.app?test-login=ai-agent-token&test-mode=true`
2. The app will automatically detect test mode and bypass OAuth
3. You'll be logged in as "AI Test Agent" without any popup or OAuth flow
4. Test mode indicator (ðŸ§ª) should appear in the UI
5. All features will be accessible for comprehensive testing

**Verification Steps**:
```
1. Check URL parameters are processed correctly
2. Verify automatic login without OAuth popup
3. Confirm test user context is active
4. Look for test mode indicators in UI
5. Validate all CRUD operations work normally
```

**Test Mode Features**:
- Bypasses Google OAuth completely
- Provides isolated test user account
- Enables full feature testing
- Maintains realistic user scenarios
- Allows comprehensive automation

## Test Categories

### 1. Authentication & Access Tests

#### 1.1 Standard OAuth Login
```
STEPS:
1. Navigate to https://bob20250810.web.app
2. Click "Sign in with Google" button
3. Complete OAuth flow in popup
4. Verify successful login and redirect to dashboard

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- OAuth popup appears without ezrrors

```

#### 1.2 Side Door Authentication (AI Testing)
```
STEPS:
1. Navigate to test URL: https://bob20250810.web.app?test-login=ai-agent-token&test-mode=true
2. Verify automatic login without OAuth
3. Check test user indicator in UI
4. Verify all features accessible

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Automatic login bypassing OAuth

```

#### 1.3 OAuth vs Side Door Comparison
```
FOR AI TESTING - USE SIDE DOOR:
âœ… No OAuth complexity
âœ… No Google account required
