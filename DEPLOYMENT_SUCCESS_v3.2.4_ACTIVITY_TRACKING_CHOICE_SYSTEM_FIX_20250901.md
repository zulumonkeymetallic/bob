# BOB v3.2.4 - Activity Tracking & Choice System Fix Deployment Success

## üéØ DEPLOYMENT SUMMARY
**Version:** v3.2.4  
**Date:** September 1, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL  
**Build Time:** ~3 minutes  
**Bundle Size:** 450.47 kB (gzipped) - 4.76 kB increase for comprehensive fixes  

## üîß CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### Activity Tracking Firestore Error Resolution
- **Problem:** `FirebaseError: Function addDoc() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field referenceNumber)`
- **Root Cause:** ActivityStreamService was passing undefined values to Firestore, which doesn't accept undefined field values
- **Solution:** Filter and sanitize all activity data before saving to Firestore

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Before (causing Firestore errors)
await addDoc(collection(db, 'activity_stream'), {
  referenceNumber: referenceNumber, // Could be undefined
  ...activityData
});

// After (filtered undefined values)
const sanitizedData = Object.fromEntries(
  Object.entries(activityData).filter(([_, value]) => value !== undefined)
);
await addDoc(collection(db, 'activity_stream'), sanitizedData);
```

### ServiceNow Choice System Migration Completion
- **Problem:** Demo components and utilities still using string-based choice values
- **Root Cause:** Incomplete migration from string to integer choice system
- **Solution:** Update all remaining components to use integer choice values and helper functions

## üóÇÔ∏è SERVICENOW CHOICE SYSTEM STATUS

### Migration Coverage Complete
- ‚úÖ ModernGoalsTable: Inline editing fixed with integer choice values
- ‚úÖ ModernTableDemo: All demo data converted to integer choices
- ‚úÖ SprintPlanner: Theme colors and status handling updated
- ‚úÖ ActivityStreamService: All activity logging methods sanitized
- ‚úÖ Choice helper functions: Working correctly across all components

### Choice Value Mappings Verified
- **Goal Status:** 0=New, 1=Work in Progress, 2=Complete, 3=Blocked, 4=Deferred
- **Task Status:** 0=New, 1=Work in Progress, 2=Complete, 3=Blocked, 4=Deferred
- **Priority:** 1=High, 2=Medium, 3=Low
- **Theme:** 1=Health, 2=Growth, 3=Wealth, 4=Tribe, 5=Home

## üìù CONVENTIONAL COMMITS COMPLIANCE

### Multi-Scope Commit Format Applied
```
fix(activity-tracking): resolve undefined referenceNumber in Firestore documents
