# BOB v3.5.3 - Enhanced Story Table Integration & Console Logging

**Deployment Date**: September 1, 2025  
**Version**: v3.5.3  
**Build Time**: ${new Date().toISOString()}  
**Git Tag**: v3.5.3  

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### ✅ Fixed Story Display Issue
**Problem**: Goals were showing card-based story view instead of ModernStoriesTable  
**Solution**: Modified GoalsCardView to always render ModernStoriesTable, removing conditional rendering  
**Result**: Consistent table experience across all goal expansion scenarios  

### ✅ Enhanced Console Logging
Added comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring:

#### Goal Expansion Tracking:
```
🎯 GoalsCardView: Stories button clicked
🎯 Goal: {goalId} {goalTitle}
🎯 Action: EXPANDING/COLLAPSING
🎯 Current stories count: {count}
🎯 User: {email}
```

#### Story Loading Monitoring:
```
📚 ModernGoalsTable: Starting story load
📚 Goal ID: {goalId}
📚 User: {email}
📚 Persona: {persona}
📚 Stories found: {count}
```

#### UI Interaction Logging:
```
✏️ ModernGoalsTable: Edit button clicked
✏️ Goal: {goalId} {goalTitle}
✏️ Has onEditModal prop: {boolean}
📊 ModernStoriesTable: Component mounted/updated
📊 Stories count: {count}
```

### ✅ Version Management
- Updated package.json to v3.5.3
- Updated version.ts with new build information
- Created proper git tag and pushed to GitHub
- Synchronized version across all deployment channels

### ✅ Edit Modal Consistency (Previously Fixed)
- GoalsManagement now includes EditGoalModal component
- Both card view and list view use identical edit modal
- Proper prop passing and state management
