### üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

#### Navigation Issues Debugging:
If menu navigation still doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify React Router is working: manually enter `/dashboard` in URL
3. Check if `handleNavigation()` function is being called
4. Ensure `setShowSidebar(false)` is not interfering

#### Drag & Drop Issues:
The old kanban (/kanban) doesn't have drag-and-drop. Use:
1. **For Planning:** `/sprint-planning` (has full DnD)
2. **For Execution:** `/current-sprint` (has ModernTaskTable)

#### Activity Stream Issues:
Activity stream appears in GlobalSidebar when:
1. An item (story/task/goal) is selected
2. Recent activities exist in Firestore  
3. User has proper permissions
