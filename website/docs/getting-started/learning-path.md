# Learning Path

Hermes Agent can do a lot — CLI assistant, Telegram/Discord bot, task automation, RL training, and more. This page helps you figure out where to start and what to read based on your experience level and what you're trying to accomplish.

:::tip Start Here
If you haven't installed Hermes Agent yet, begin with the [Installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) and then run through the [Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart). Everything below assumes you have a working installation.
:::

## How to Use This Page

- **Know your level?** Jump to the [experience-level table](#by-experience-level) and follow the reading order for your tier.
- **Have a specific goal?** Skip to [By Use Case](#by-use-case) and find the scenario that matches.
- **Just browsing?** Check the [Key Features](#key-features-at-a-glance) table for a quick overview of everything Hermes Agent can do.

## By Use Case

Pick the scenario that matches what you want to do. Each one links you to the relevant docs in the order you should read them.

### "I want a CLI coding assistant"

Use Hermes Agent as an interactive terminal assistant for writing, reviewing, and running code.

1. [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation)
2. [Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart)
3. [CLI Usage](/docs/user-guide/cli)
4. [Code Execution](/docs/user-guide/features/code-execution)
5. [Context Files](/docs/user-guide/features/context-files)
6. [Tips & Tricks](/docs/guides/tips)

:::tip
Pass files directly into your conversation with context files. Hermes Agent can read, edit, and run code in your projects.
:::

### "I want a Telegram/Discord bot"

Deploy Hermes Agent as a bot on your favorite messaging platform.

1. [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation)
2. [Configuration](/docs/user-guide/configuration)
3. [Messaging Overview](/docs/user-guide/messaging)
4. [Telegram Setup](/docs/user-guide/messaging/telegram)
5. [Discord Setup](/docs/user-guide/messaging/discord)
6. [Security](/docs/user-guide/security)

For full project examples, see:
- [Daily Briefing Bot](/docs/guides/daily-briefing-bot)
- [Team Telegram Assistant](/docs/guides/team-telegram-assistant)

### "I want to automate tasks"

Schedule recurring tasks, run batch jobs, or chain agent actions together.

1. [Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart)
2. [Cron Scheduling](/docs/user-guide/features/cron)
3. [Batch Processing](/docs/user-guide/features/batch-processing)
4. [Delegation](/docs/user-guide/features/delegation)
5. [Hooks](/docs/user-guide/features/hooks)

:::tip
Cron jobs let Hermes Agent run tasks on a schedule — daily summaries, periodic checks, automated reports — without you being present.
:::

### "I want to build custom tools/skills"

Extend Hermes Agent with your own tools and reusable skill packages.

1. [Tools Overview](/docs/user-guide/features/tools)
2. [Skills Overview](/docs/user-guide/features/skills)
3. [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](/docs/user-guide/features/mcp)
4. [Architecture](/docs/developer-guide/architecture)
5. [Adding Tools](/docs/developer-guide/adding-tools)
6. [Creating Skills](/docs/developer-guide/creating-skills)

:::tip
Tools are individual functions the agent can call. Skills are bundles of tools, prompts, and configuration packaged together. Start with tools, graduate to skills.
:::

### "I want to train models"

Use reinforcement learning to fine-tune model behavior with Hermes Agent's built-in RL training pipeline.

1. [Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart)
2. [Configuration](/docs/user-guide/configuration)
3. [RL Training](/docs/user-guide/features/rl-training)
4. [Provider Routing](/docs/user-guide/features/provider-routing)
5. [Architecture](/docs/developer-guide/architecture)

:::tip
RL training works best when you already understand the basics of how Hermes Agent handles conversations and tool calls. Run through the Beginner path first if you're new.
:::

### "I want to use it as a Python library"

Integrate Hermes Agent into your own Python applications programmatically.

1. [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation)
2. [Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart)
