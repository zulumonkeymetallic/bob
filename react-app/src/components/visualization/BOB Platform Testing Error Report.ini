BOB Platform Testing Error Report
Test Environment and Setup
Date of Testing: 1 September 2025
User: AI Test Agent (side‑door test account).
Access Method: Side‑door authentication (?test‑login=ai‑agent‑token&test‑mode=true) using Chromium browser.
Starting State: No existing goals, stories or tasks in the Personal or Work personas.
The side‑door login process worked correctly. On navigating to the test URL, the application automatically logged in without any OAuth prompts. The header showed the TEST indicator and displayed the “AI Test Agent” persona, confirming the test environment was active

Goals Management Tests
Goal Creation
The “Goals Management” page displayed zero goals across all status categories. Attempts were made to create a new goal (title AI Test Goal – Automated Testing, theme Growth, confidence level 80 %, target date 1 October 2025). Despite filling all required fields and switching between the Personal and Work personas, clicking Create Goal triggered an error:
Error: “Failed to create goal: Missing or insufficient permissions”

.
This error occurred consistently, preventing any goal from being created. As a result, subsequent tests that depend on existing goals (status changes, filtering, list view, etc.) could not be performed.
Stories Management Tests
The “Stories Management” page correctly loaded and showed zero stories. Attempting to add a story produced a browser alert message stating that story creation is not yet implemented:
Message: “Add new story – coming soon”

.
Because story creation is unavailable, tests related to story CRUD operations, linking stories to goals, and drag‑and‑drop reordering could not be executed.
Tasks Management Tests
On the “Task List View,” clicking the floating plus button and selecting T opened a modal to add a new task. A task titled AI Testing Task with description Automated task testing and priority High was created in the form. However, when submitting the form, the application returned an error:
Error: “Failed to create task: Missing or insufficient permissions”

bob20250810.web.app
.
This prevented the creation of any tasks. Consequently, testing task status transitions, Kanban view, and sprint assignment was impossible.
Additional Observations
Side‑Door Authentication: The side‑door mechanism functioned properly. The app recognized the test user, displayed the test persona, and allowed navigation between pages

.
UI Navigation: Links to Goals Dashboard, Stories Management, Task List View, and other pages were responsive. Views switched correctly between Personal and Work personas, though the Work persona does not allow goal creation.
Unimplemented Features: Story creation is explicitly labelled “coming soon,” indicating that the feature is not yet implemented

Impact on Testing
The inability to create goals and tasks due to insufficient permissions severely limited the scope of testing. Many core functionalities (editing goals/stories/tasks, filtering, searching, sprint planning, activity streams) require existing entities. Without permission to add records, these areas could not be exercised. In addition, the unimplemented story creation feature blocked all story‑related tests.
Recommendations
Adjust Firestore/Database Permissions – Ensure the test user has write permissions for goals, stories and tasks so that CRUD operations can be thoroughly tested.
Implement Story Creation – Complete the “Add Story” feature or provide a stub that allows story creation for test purposes.
Provide Seed Data (Optional) – Pre‑populate the test environment with sample goals, stories and tasks to enable testing of filtering, status changes, sprint planning and reporting features without relying solely on creation operations.
Once these issues are addressed, the full test script can be executed to validate features such as activity streams, filtering and search, sprint planning, drag‑and‑drop, and performance metrics.
