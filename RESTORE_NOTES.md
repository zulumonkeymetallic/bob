# Project Restoration - August 30, 2025

## Summary
Successfully restored the BOB project to the last stable version (v2.1.5) after encountering TypeScript compilation issues with drag-and-drop functionality.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Git Reset to Stable Version
- **Commit**: `355101e` (tagged as v2.1.5)
- **Command**: `git reset --hard 355101e`
- **Reason**: TypeScript compilation errors with react-beautiful-dnd DropResult types

### 2. Cleanup
- Removed all untracked files with `git clean -fd`
- Cleaned up backup files that were causing conflicts

### 3. Dependencies
- Reinstalled `react-router-dom` and `@types/react-router-dom`
- All dependencies now properly resolved

### 4. Verification
- ✅ Build successful: `npm run build`
- ✅ Deployed to Firebase: https://bob20250810.web.app
- ⚠️ Minor ESLint warnings (non-blocking)

## Current State
- **Branch**: react-ui
- **Status**: Clean working tree, up to date with origin
- **Build**: Successful with warnings only
- **Deployment**: Live at https://bob20250810.web.app

## Removed During Restore
- `AUTOMATED_TEST_PLAN.md`
- `comprehensive-deploy.sh`
- `react-app/src/components/ColumnCustomizer.tsx`
- `react-app/src/components/InlineEditCell.tsx`
- Various backup files

## Next Steps
1. Address the minor ESLint warnings
2. Re-implement enhanced inline editing features (if needed)
3. Research alternative drag-and-drop libraries (see DEFECTS_TRACKING.md C35, C36)

## Lessons Learned
- Always test builds before major refactoring
- Keep stable tagged versions for easy rollback
- Backup files can interfere with TypeScript compilation
