**Architecture: Hybrid (Scheduler in Functions, GCal I/O in n8n)**
- Functions compute `/calendar/events` (idempotency: storyId+start) and conflicts.
- n8n watches event docs and performs Google Calendar create/update/delete; webhook/poll listener feeds edits back to Firestore.
- Align with related calendar maintenance (#158).
