# ADR-001 — Design System

## Decision
Adopt React + Tailwind + Radix UI + shadcn/ui + TanStack Table/AG Grid + Pragmatic DnD.

## Alternatives Considered
- Material UI: rejected (too heavy, opinionated)
- Bootstrap: rejected (dated, less flexible)
- Keep r-b-dnd: rejected (deprecated)

## Rationale
Modern, accessible, aligns with project goals.

## Status
Accepted

## History & Context
Chosen after discussion with Jim where he emphasised “use a modern design framework.”
