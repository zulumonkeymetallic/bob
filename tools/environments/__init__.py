"""Hermes execution environment backends.

Each backend provides the same interface (BaseEnvironment ABC) for running
shell commands in a specific execution context: local, Docker, Singularity,
SSH, Modal, or Daytona.

The terminal_tool.py factory (_create_environment) selects the backend
based on the TERMINAL_ENV configuration.
