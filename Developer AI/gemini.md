## üß† Core Features

### üß≠ Goal Management (Expanded)

* **Import pipeline**: CSV/Sheets ingestion ‚Üí Firestore `goals`.
* **AI clean/classify**: `goal_classify()` tags by Theme (**Health, Growth, Wealth, Tribe, Home**), sets `size`, `time_to_master_hours`, `confidence`.
* **Traceability**: stories/tasks/habits must reference a `goal_id`. Orphans flagged.
* **KPIs**: optional progress KPIs per goal (e.g., ‚Äúweekly minutes Health‚Äù, ‚Äúvelocity per sprint‚Äù).

**Data Model ‚Äì `goals`**

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string?",
  "theme": "Health|Growth|Wealth|Tribe|Home",
  "size": "XS|S|M|L|XL",
  "time_to_master_hours": 0,
  "target_date": "timestamp?",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "kpis": [{"name":"string","target":"number","unit":"string"}]?,
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp"
}
```

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Story & Task Management (Expanded)

* **Sources**: tasks from **iOS Reminders**, Web UI, AI suggestions, Gmail extraction (Phase 2).
* **AI linking**: BOB proposes Goal/Story with `ai_suggested_links` + `confidence`; above threshold auto‚Äëapplies, else appears in **Needs Review**.
* **Unlinked report**: Any `goal_ids=[]` (or `has_goal=false`) listed in a dedicated Web report with inline edits + bulk actions.
* **Dependencies**: tasks support blockers (`blocked_by[]`) and `depends_on[]` to inform scheduling.

**Data Model ‚Äì `stories`**

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "goal_id": "string",
  "status": "backlog|active|done",
  "priority": "P1|P2|P3",

* `tasks(goal_ids array_contains, due_date asc)`
* `stories(goal_id, status, order_index)`

---

### üìÖ Smart Calendaring (Expanded + Web‚ÄëManaged)

**Goal:** Respect **hard blocks** and intelligently auto‚Äëfill remaining time with goal‚Äëaligned blocks (Tribe, Chores, Gaming, Fitness, Daily Well‚Äëbeing, Sauna, Sleep). **All scheduling is managed from the Web App**, which writes to **Google Calendar**. iOS reflects updates via native Google Calendar sync (no direct iOS calendar writes by BOB).

**Capabilities**

* **Hard Blocks (Non‚Äënegotiables)**: user‚Äëcreated or imported GCal events that AI cannot move (work 09:00‚Äì17:00, family events, travel).
* **Soft Blocks (Preferred Windows)**: moveable guidance (e.g., Gym 06:00‚Äì07:00).
* **Auto‚ÄëFill Categories**: Tribe, Chores, Gaming, Fitness (Run, CrossFit, S\&C, Swim), Daily Well‚Äëbeing (meditation, journaling, walk), Sauna, Sleep.
* **Recovery‚ÄëAware Scheduling**: If **HRV low** / sleep debt high, AI reduces intensity and lengthens sleep/recovery. Integrate **Runna** (plan) and **Strava** (recent load) when enabled.
* **Daily & Weekly Replans**: morning freshen pass; weekly sprint re‚Äëplan.
* **Explainability**: each changed/added block stores a human‚Äëreadable `rationale`.

**Inputs**: Google Calendar (events, hard/soft metadata), HealthKit (HRV/RHR/sleep/steps), Runna (plan), Strava (workouts), user prefs.

**Web Calendar Management**

* **Create/Update/Delete blocks** in Web ‚Üí **Google Calendar API** (primary or selected calendar).
* **Reflect external changes**: pull deltas from GCal; update local `calendar_blocks` + UI.
* **Conflict detection**: validator prevents overlaps with hard blocks/quiet hours/facility hours.
* **iOS behaviour**: iOS shows all changes via its built‚Äëin Google account sync automatically.

**Data Models**

`availability_blocks`

```json
{ "id":"string","type":"hard|soft","title":"string","start":"ts","end":"ts","recurrence":"string?","source":"user|ai","notes":"string?","created_at":"ts","updated_at":"ts" }
```

`planning_prefs`

```json
{ "uid":"string","wake_time":"HH:mm","sleep_time":"HH:mm","quiet_hours":[{"start":"HH:mm","end":"HH:mm"}],"max_hi_sessions_per_week":2,"min_recovery_gap_hours":24,"weekly_theme_targets":{"Health":300,"Tribe":240,"Wealth":300,"Growth":240,"Home":180},"pool_hours":[{"day":1,"open":"06:00","close":"22:00"}]?,"gym_hours":[],"auto_apply_threshold":0.8 }
```

`health_daily`

```json
{ "date":"YYYY-MM-DD","hrv_ms":null,"rhr":null,"sleep_minutes":null,"sleep_efficiency":null,"steps":null,"strain_index":null,"status":"good|moderate|poor","source":"healthkit" }
```

`training_plan` (Runna)

```json
{ "date":"YYYY-MM-DD","session_type":"tempo|long_run|intervals|easy","duration_min":60,"target_rpe":6,"source":"runna" }
```

`workouts` (Strava)

```json
{ "date":"YYYY-MM-DD","sport":"run|ride|swim|strength|crossfit","duration_min":50,"distance_km":10.2,"avg_hr":150,"tss_like":45,"source":"strava" }
```

`calendar_blocks`

```json
{
  "id":"string",
  "google_event_id":"string?",
  "task_id":"string?",
  "goal_id":"string?",
  "theme":"Health|Growth|Wealth|Tribe|Home",
  "category":"Tribe|Chores|Gaming|Fitness|Wellbeing|Sauna|Sleep",
  "start":"timestamp","end":"timestamp",
  "flexibility":"hard|soft",
  "status":"proposed|applied|superseded",
  "color_id":"string?","visibility":"default|private",
  "created_by":"ai|user",
  "rationale":"string?",
  "version":1,"superseded_by":"block_id?"
}
```

**Guardrails**

1. Never move **hard** blocks.
2. Respect wake/sleep and quiet hours.
3. Enforce `min_recovery_gap_hours` between HI sessions.
4. Maintain/extend sleep when recovery poor.

**Recovery Logic**

* `status=poor`: replace CrossFit/Intervals/Long Run with mobility + easy walk ‚â§45‚Ä≤; add Sauna (if allowed); bring bedtime earlier +30‚Äì60‚Ä≤.
* `status=moderate`: downgrade intensity (tempo ‚Üí easy; CrossFit ‚Üí strength accessories + mobility).
* `status=good`: follow plan; optional strides/extension.

**LLM Planning Loop**

* **Step 0** Assemble context (7‚Äëday horizon): availability, GCal events, prefs, health, Runna, Strava, theme targets.
* **Step 1** LLM drafts `calendar_blocks` to maximize theme attainment, minimize rule violations/fragmentation.
* **Step 2** Server validator rejects collisions, quiet‚Äëhour breaches, recovery gaps; returns diff.
* **Step 3** LLM repairs; server applies if score ‚â• threshold, else show Review Pane.
* **Step 4** Apply to Firestore and push to **Google Calendar**; store `google_event_id`.
* **Step 5** Notify with rationale summary and one‚Äëclick overrides (Lock, Undo, Keep HI anyway).

**Acceptance Criteria ‚Äì Smart Calendaring**

* [ ] 0 hard‚Äëblock collisions after validator.
* [ ] When `health_daily.status="poor"`, all HI sessions replaced/downgraded with rationale.
* [ ] Weekly plan hits ‚â•90% of `weekly_theme_targets` unless impossible (explain shortfall).
* [ ] Sleep minutes meet baseline on ‚â•6/7 days or explicit reason logged.
* [ ] Runna enabled ‚Üí ‚â•80% prescribed sessions scheduled in week (days may shift).
* [ ] All created blocks exist in Google Calendar with `google_event_id` within 5s of Apply.
* [ ] Web edits to blocks reflect back from GCal within 15s (delta sync).
* [ ] iOS devices show changes via native GCal integration (no BOB iOS writes).

**Security & Privacy**: store only required aggregates from HealthKit; tokens least‚Äëscope; LLM prompts pass abstracted signals (e.g., `hrv_z=-1.2`).

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Web App UX ‚Äì High‚ÄëFidelity Requirements

### 1) **Kanban ‚Äì Stories**

* **Columns**: Backlog, Active, Done (configurable).
* **Cards**: story title, goal chip, points, status, priority, progress bar (#tasks done/#total).
* **D\&D**: reorder within column; move across columns updates `status` (and `sprint_id` when moved into Active during an open sprint).
* **Quick add**: ‚Äú+ Task‚Äù on card creates task linked to story.

**Story Detail Drawer/Page** (opens on click)

* Header: title, goal chip, status, priority, points, edit inline.
* **Tasks Table** (linked to this story):

  * Columns: Title, Status, Effort, Due, Priority, Labels, Blocked By, Estimate (min), Assoc. Goal (chip), Source.
  * Features: sort, filter, search; inline edit; bulk operations (Set Goal, Set Due, Set Status).
  * Actions: add checklist items, attach files, open in Reminders (if `source=ios_reminder`).
* Right rail: Acceptance Criteria, Notes, Activity (change\_log).

**Acceptance Criteria ‚Äì Kanban & Story Detail**

* [ ] D\&D reorders persist within 300ms and survive reload.
* [ ] Opening a story shows 100% of its linked tasks with live filters.
* [ ] Inline edits are optimistic with rollback on error.

### 2) **Goals Page ‚Äì Drilldown**

* **Goals Table**: Title, Theme, Size, Target Date, Progress (% tasks done), Stories (#), Tasks (#), Next Milestone.
* Click a **Goal** ‚Üí **Nested View**:

  * **Stories subtable** grouped under the goal (Title, Status, Points, Progress).
  * Each story row expandable to **Tasks subtable** (same columns as Story Detail).
  * Bulk actions at goal level: Create Story, Link Tasks, Set Theme, Export (CSV).
* Metrics panel: velocity, weekly minutes by theme, overdue tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria ‚Äì Goals Drilldown**

* [ ] Nested view shows all stories under goal and their tasks without page reload.
* [ ] Bulk link of selected tasks attaches to goal and (optionally) a chosen story.
* [ ] Export produces CSV of current filtered set (UTF‚Äë8, headers).

### 3) **Unlinked Tasks Report**

* Virtualised table for large sets; filters: source, due range, effort, text search.
* Chips display **AI Suggested Links** with confidence + rationale tooltip; Accept/Reject/Edit.
* Keyboard shortcuts: `G` assign Goal, `S` assign Story, `D` due date, `T` theme.

### 4) **Planner Review Pane (Smart Calendar)**

* Shows proposed/changed blocks with badges: *Recovery‚Äëadjusted*, *Theme Target*, *Conflict Repair*.
* Controls: **Apply**, **Undo**, **Lock**, **Snooze**.
* Timeline preview (week/day) with drag adjust (snap to 5‚Äëmin grid).

---

## üìä Persona Analytics

* Breakdowns by **Theme** (Health, Growth, Wealth, Tribe, Home).
* Roles: *Maker*, *Manager*, *Admin*.
* Energy bands vs HRV; context switching; mean task duration.
* Weekly digest with trends and nudges (reduce switches, protect sleep, re‚Äëbalance themes).
* Extended metrics (from future phases): **Comms load** (emails triaged, reply latency), **Financial discipline** (budget adherence).

**Data Model ‚Äì `persona_metrics_daily`**

```json
{
  "date":"YYYY-MM-DD",
  "by_theme": {"Health": {"min":120}, "Wealth": {"min":60}},
  "by_role": {"Maker": 180, "Manager": 120, "Admin": 60},

## ‚öôÔ∏è Engineering Notes

**Cloud Functions (Callable/HTTP)**

* `goal_classify()` ‚Äì classify/clean goals.
* `ingestReminders()` ‚Äì idempotent upsert from iOS.
* `suggestLinks()` ‚Äì propose task ‚Üí goal/story links.
* `queueReminderUpdate(taskId, payload)` ‚Äì push back due/title/status to Reminders (when source is Reminders).
* `planCalendar()` ‚Äì run LLM planning loop (draft ‚Üí validate ‚Üí repair).
* `syncGoogleCalendarDelta()` ‚Äì pull/push event deltas; maintain `google_event_id`.
* `aggregatePersonaMetrics(date)` ‚Äì daily rollup.
* `ingestGmailHistory()` (Phase 2).
* `ingestFinanceSheet()` (Phase 3).

**Validator Predicates (server)**

* No overlap with `availability_blocks.type=hard`.
* All blocks within `[wake_time, sleep_time]` and outside `quiet_hours`.
* `HI` sessions ‚â• `min_recovery_gap_hours` apart and not scheduled when `status=poor`.
* Swim/Gym only within facility hours if configured.
* Transition buffers ‚â• 10 min around gym/pool.

**Security & Privacy**

* Firestore Security Rules: owner‚Äëonly access by `uid`.
* Token scopes: least privilege (GCal read/write events; Gmail read‚Äëonly initially; Sheets read; Strava/Runna read).
* HealthKit: store only derived aggregates (no raw PII).
* Right to be forgotten: purge mirrored + derived data.

**Dev Guidelines**

* TypeScript + React hooks; Swift + BackgroundTasks on iOS.
* Unit, integration, E2E tests; Lighthouse performance budgets.
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions ‚Üí Firebase Hosting; Firestore emulator for PRs.
* Backup: scheduled exports to GCS; restore playbook.
