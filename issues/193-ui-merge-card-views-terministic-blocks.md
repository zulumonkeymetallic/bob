# 193 â€“ UI: Merge Card-Based Views & Preserve Terministic Calendar Blocks

## Summary
Consolidate the two existing card UIs into a single, consistent implementation that preserves the "Terministic Calendar Blocks" concept. Unify styling, sizing, zoom behaviour, drag/resize, and context menus; remove duplicate components and dead code.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A single Card component library is used across Roadmap and Kanban.
- Zooming keeps card text readable and card sizing consistent at multiple scales.
- Dragging and resizing works smoothly; cards never disappear behind date bars; sticky headers remain visible.
- Context menus and keyboard shortcuts behave consistently.
- No duplicate view logic; one source of truth.

## Proposed Technical Approach
- Create a `ui/cards` package with primitives (Card, CardGrid, CardBlock, CardMenu).
- Extract shared drag/resize hooks; standardise z-index/stacking.
- Implement a zoom manager with breakpoints and clamped font scaling.
- Refactor date bar to `position: sticky` with intersection observers to avoid overlap.
- Remove deprecated components; add storybook docs.
