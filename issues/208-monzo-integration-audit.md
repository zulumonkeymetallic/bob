# 208 – Monzo integration audit & gap analysis

- Type: review / audit
- Priority: P0
- Areas: Finance, Integrations, Goals, Analytics

## Problem
Implementation issues cover OAuth, syncing, categorisation, and dashboards, but there is no comprehensive review ensuring Monzo data aligns to goals/themes with actionable recommendations. The requirements specification mandates a holistic audit report and remediation roadmap.

## Objectives
1. **Security & Data Handling Review**
   - Verify secure import of Monzo transactions, pots, and account metadata (token storage, least privilege access).
   - Confirm enrichment (merchant, category, timestamp, pot) is complete and consistent.
2. **Goal & Theme Alignment**
   - Assess mapping of transactions to goals/themes (e.g., Wealth → Savings) including mandatory vs optional spend.
   - Evaluate dashboards for highlighting alignment/misalignment; identify missing roll-ups.
3. **Categorisation Rules**
   - Review rule-based reclassification by merchant/category and support for custom user-defined categories.
   - Test conflict resolution and precedence ordering.
4. **Dashboards & Reporting**
   - Validate graphs for spend by theme, monthly/annual variance tracking, and snowball budgeting outputs.
   - Check responsiveness/accessibility of finance dashboards.
5. **Gap Analysis Deliverables**
   - Produce audit report summarizing findings, risks, and recommended fixes (e.g., merchant reclassification, missing roll-ups, pot alignment gaps).
   - Prioritize remediation plan with owners and timelines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Completed audit report stored in repo (docs/monzo-audit-YYYYMMDD.md or similar) with actionable findings.
- [ ] Security review confirms credential handling and logging hygiene; issues logged if gaps found.
- [ ] Goal/theme alignment verified across sample data sets with variance noted.
- [ ] Categorisation engine validated for custom rules and conflict handling.
- [ ] Dashboard assessment documents coverage gaps and UX concerns.
- [ ] Recommendations feed into follow-up issues / tasks with severity tags.

## Dependencies
- Availability of latest Monzo integration code (`issues/186`-`190`).
- Access to representative transaction datasets (sanitized or sandbox).

## Notes
- Coordinate with FinanceAgent owners for interview notes.
- Consider external compliance review if PII handling changes.
