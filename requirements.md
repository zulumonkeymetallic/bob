## 0. Purpose & Audience
This document merges the **product requirements** and the **engineering blueprint** so another AI/development team can run a gap analysis directly against the codebase. It captures vision, personas, flows, data schemas, acceptance criteria, validator rules, and delivery milestones.

---

## 1. Vision & Personas
BOB (‚ÄúJake‚Äù) is a **personal + work life‚Äëmanagement platform** with an **agentic AI** that plans, prioritises, and schedules across two **personas** under one account:
- **Personal:** Goals ‚Üí Stories ‚Üí Tasks, Habits, Health, Finance.
- **Work:** Projects ‚Üí Tasks (no goal linkage required).

**Key rule:** Tasks from both personas sync to iOS Reminders (two separate lists). All other artefacts remain persona‚Äëscoped and never cross‚Äëlink.

**Persona UX**
- Global **Persona Switcher** (header): *Personal | Work* with distinct accent/badge.
- Switch cascades to boards, filters, reports, AI planner scope, imports/exports.

**Persona ‚Üí iOS Lists**
- Personal ‚Üí **‚ÄúBOB ‚Äì Personal‚Äù**
- Work ‚Üí **‚ÄúBOB ‚Äì Work‚Äù**

**AI Planner scope**
- Runs per‚Äëpersona by default; cross‚Äëpersona scheduling (e.g., personal task during work hours) requires explicit confirmation.

---

## 2. Scope & Phases
**Phase 1 ‚Äì Personal Productivity (MVP)**
- Personas, Goals/Stories/Tasks (Personal), Work Projects/Tasks (Work).
- Story **cannot** be marked Complete if any linked Task is open.
- Goal progress bar = (# stories Done / # stories total).
- Kanban (Stories) + **separate** Tasks List view.
- Agentic AI ‚Üí writes **Google Calendar** blocks (iOS reflects via native sync).
- Daily Habits, HealthKit ingestion; basic Finance panel (CSV import).

**Phase 2 ‚Äì Finance & Gmail**
- Finance dashboards (budgets, trends, alerts ‚Üí tasks); Gmail AI triage & task extraction.

**Phase 3 ‚Äì Smart Home**
- HomeKit/Nest/lights with context‚Äëaware routines tied to schedule/recovery.

**Weekend Milestone (Focus)**
- Load **Goals from templates/CSV**.
- **Stories Kanban** + **Tasks List** (separate views; drill‚Äëdowns).
- Goal progress bars fed by Stories‚Äô status.
- **Agentic AI scheduling to Google Calendar** (no iOS Reminders sync required yet).
- Persona switcher skeleton (scopes boards, not all reports).

---

## 3. Architecture Overview
- **Frontend (Web):** React + TypeScript, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Vite.
- **iOS App:** Swift/SwiftUI, Firebase SDK, HealthKit, EventKit/Reminders.
- **Backend:** Firebase Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage.
- **AI:** GPT APIs (chat, classification, planning, STT/TTS).
- **Integrations:** Google Calendar, iOS Reminders (two lists), HealthKit, Strava, Runna, MyFitnessPal, (Phase 2) Gmail, Google Sheets.
- **Scheduling model:** Web app writes to **Google Calendar**; iOS reflects via native GCal sync.

---

## 5. Firestore Structure & Indexes
**Collections (persona‚Äëscoped):**
```
personal.goals, personal.stories, personal.tasks, personal.habits, personal.finance_items,
personal.training_plan, personal.workouts, personal.health_daily

work.projects, work.tasks

shared.calendar_blocks, shared.planning_prefs, emails, personal.transactions
```

**Recommended Indexes (examples)**
- `tasks`: `(persona, status, due_date desc)`
- `tasks`: `(persona, has_goal)`
- `tasks`: `(persona, parent_type, parent_id, status)`
- `stories`: `(goal_id, status, order_index)`
- `calendar_blocks`: `(persona, start asc)`
- `finance_items`: `(date desc, category)`

---

## 6. Integrations
- **Google Calendar:** source of truth for scheduling; server pushes blocks; delta sync back to Firestore.
- **iOS Reminders:** two‚Äëway sync; list mapping by persona; defer to Phase‚Äë1.5 unless needed.
- **HealthKit:** VO‚ÇÇ Max, HRV, RHR, steps, screen time (store aggregates only).
- **Strava/Runna:** read training plan and completed workouts.
- **MyFitnessPal:** nutrition via HealthKit or direct (if available).
- **Gmail & Sheets (Phase 2/3):** AI triage; Sheets finance ingestion.

---

## 7. Web UX (High‚ÄëFidelity Requirements)
### 7.1 Stories Kanban (Personal)
- Columns: Backlog, Active, Done (configurable).
- Cards: title, goal chip, points, status, **progress bar (#tasks done/#total)**.
- D&D reorder and column move; persists within 300ms (optimistic UI).

**Story Detail Drawer**
- Header: title, goal chip, status, priority, points (inline edit).
- **Tasks Table** (linked tasks only): columns Title, Status, Effort, Due, Priority, Labels, Blocked By, Estimate, Source.
- Actions: inline edits, bulk ops (Set Status/Due/Priority/Labels).

**Rule:** Story cannot transition to **done** while any linked task `status != "done"` (server‚Äëenforced).

### 7.2 Tasks List (Personal & Work)
- Independent list view (not in Story modal). Persona filter applied.
- Columns: Title, Status, Effort, Due, Parent (Story/Project), Theme/Goal (chips), Source.
- Filters: persona, status, due range, source, text, labels.
- Keyboard shortcuts: `E` edit, `S` status, `D` due, `G` set goal, `P` set parent.

### 7.3 Goals Page (Personal)
- Table: Title, Theme, Size, Target Date, Progress %, #Stories, #Tasks, Next Milestone.
- Clicking a Goal shows nested **Stories** ‚Üí expandable **Tasks**.
- Bulk actions: Create Story, Link Tasks, Export CSV.

### 7.4 Work Kanban (Work)
- Projects ‚Üí Tasks board; no goal/story links.
- Quick add ‚Äú+ Task‚Äù on Project cards.

### 7.5 Unlinked Tasks Report
- Virtualised grid for large N.
- Chipped AI suggestions with confidence + rationale tooltip.
- Bulk link/edit; ‚ÄúAccept All ‚â• threshold‚Äù.

### 7.6 Planner Review Pane
- Proposed/changed blocks with badges: *Recovery‚Äëadjusted*, *Theme Target*, *Conflict Repair*.
- Controls: **Apply**, **Undo**, **Lock**, **Snooze**.
- Timeline preview (week/day), snap to 5‚Äëmin grid.

### 7.7 Habits & Finance Panels
- Habits: streaks, adherence %, quick log, toggle auto‚Äëblocks.
- Finance: budget vs actual, rolling 90 days, alerts ‚Üí ‚ÄúCreate Task‚Äù.

---

## 8. iOS App (Conversational UX)
- **Chat interface** closely mirroring ChatGPT (streamed responses, inline action chips).
- **Voice:** robust **STT/TTS** via high‚Äëquality APIs (e.g., OpenAI). Goal: near‚Äëidentical experience to ChatGPT‚Äôs native app.
- Views: Personal Kanban, Work Kanban, Tasks List, Habits, Finance (read + quick add), Calendar hints.
- Two‚Äëway Reminders sync with separate lists; HealthKit ingestion; offline queue & retry.

---

## 9. Agentic AI Planner
**Inputs:** persona scope, tasks/stories/goals, planning prefs, availability blocks, GCal events, health/recovery, Runna plan, Strava workouts.  
**Constraints:** hard blocks, quiet hours, wake/sleep, facility hours, `min_recovery_gap_hours`, weekly theme targets, WIP limits.  
**Outputs:** `calendar_blocks` with rationale + Google events.

**LLM Planning Loop**
1. Assemble 7‚Äëday context.
2. LLM drafts candidate blocks to maximise theme attainment, minimise rule violations/fragmentation.
3. **Server validator** rejects collisions & rule breaks; returns diff + reasons.
4. LLM repairs; if score ‚â• `auto_apply_threshold` ‚Üí apply. Else show **Planner Review Pane**.
5. Apply to Firestore and push to Google Calendar; store `google_event_id`. Notify with rationale.

**Validator Predicates**
- No overlap with **hard** blocks.
- All blocks within `[wake_time, sleep_time]` and outside `quiet_hours`.
- High‚Äëintensity sessions not allowed when `health_daily.status="poor"`; ensure ‚â• `min_recovery_gap_hours`.
- Swim/Gym only within facility hours when configured.
- Transition buffers ‚â• 10 min around gym/pool travel.

**Acceptance (Smart Calendaring)**
- 0 hard‚Äëblock collisions.
- Poor‚Äërecovery downgrades/defers HI sessions with rationale.
- ‚â•90% of weekly theme minutes planned unless infeasible (explain shortfall).
- Runna on ‚Üí ‚â•80% prescribed sessions scheduled.
- GCal events created & delta‚Äësynced back within SLOs (see ¬ß12).

---

## 10. Security & Privacy
- **Schema‚Äëlevel separation**: `personal.*` vs `work.*`; no cross‚Äëpersona links.
- Tokens carry persona claims; Firestore Security Rules enforce.
- PII minimisation: store health aggregates only.
- Encrypted at rest/in transit; secrets in env vars (Functions).

---

## 11. Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Conflicting edits ‚Üí last‚Äëwrite wins + change_log; user can revert.
- iOS Reminders offline ‚Üí queue & retry; warn if divergence > N hours.
- Import validation: orphan tasks/stories; duplicate IDs; invalid dates.
- Deleting a Story with open Tasks ‚Üí block; offer bulk complete/move.
- Calendar API rate limits ‚Üí backoff; partial apply with retry cursor.

---

## 12. Import/Export & SLOs
- **Import:** CSV/XLSX for Goals/Stories/Tasks/Habits/Finance; validation report.
- **Export:** CSV/JSON snapshots; Markdown reports for reviews.
- **SLOs:** 
  - GCal delta pull ‚Üí UI ‚â§ 15s
  - Block apply ‚Üí `google_event_id` ‚â§ 5s
  - HealthKit rollup ingest ‚â§ 60s from device write

---

## 13. Reporting & Analytics
- Weekly sprint summary per persona: completed, slipped, next‚Äëup.
- Habit adherence + streaks; suggested windows.
- Finance trends (variance, merchant drift); budgets at risk.
- Time allocation: by Goal Area (Personal) and by Project (Work).
- **Audit log** of AI actions (who/what/why), with revert link.

---

## 14. Acceptance Criteria (Per Feature)
**Personas**
- Switcher isolates data; no cross‚Äëbleed. Tasks sync to correct iOS lists.

**Goals/Stories/Tasks**
- Story **cannot** complete with open Tasks (server‚Äëenforced; user sees message).
- Goal progress auto‚Äëupdates as Stories reach `done`.
- Tasks List is a separate view from Stories Kanban; both live‚Äëfilter by persona.

**Work Projects**
- Work Tasks exist without Goals/Stories; appear on Work Kanban & Tasks List.

**Unlinked Tasks**
- Report lists all unlinked; AI suggestions with justification; bulk Accept/Reject/Edit.

**Habits**
- Create/log; show streaks %; optional auto‚Äëblocks; adherence in weekly report.

**Finance**
- CSV import; dashboards; alerts create tasks; variance shown by category/month.

**Smart Calendaring**
- Meets validator predicates; explains reschedules; all writes visible in GCal & UI.

**iOS App**
- Chat UX mirrors ChatGPT (stream + inline actions); robust STT/TTS; two‚Äëway Reminders; HealthKit ingest.

---

## 15. Cloud Functions (Examples)
- `goal_classify()` ‚Äì clean/classify/import goals.
- `suggestLinks()` ‚Äì propose task ‚Üí goal/story links with confidence.
- `planCalendar()` ‚Äì planning loop + validator.
- `syncGoogleCalendarDelta()` ‚Äì delta pull/push; maintain `google_event_id`.
- `ingestReminders()` ‚Äì idempotent upsert; list ‚Üí persona mapping.
- `aggregatePersonaMetrics(date)` ‚Äì daily rollup.
- Phase 2+: `ingestGmailHistory()`, `ingestFinanceSheet()`.

- **Promote Task ‚Üí Story** when: estimated effort > threshold (e.g., >240 min), multiple blockers/dependencies, or belongs to multi‚Äëday calendar occupancy.  
- **Promote Story ‚Üí Goal** when: Story aggregates ‚â•3 sibling stories or spans multiple sprints with distinct outcomes.  
- **Demote Story ‚Üí Task** when: small, single‚Äësession item with no subtasks.  
- **Demote Goal ‚Üí Story** when: narrow scope and single outcome; no multi‚Äëstory structure.

**Flow**
1. User requests promotion/demotion **or** AI proposes via `promotion_suggestions` queue.  
2. Confirmation modal shows **rationale**, **impact preview** (links that will be created/moved), and allows **field mapping**.  
3. On apply: create target entity, re‚Äëlink children, preserve backlinks, write to change_log.

**Data**
- Extend `tasks`, `stories`, `goals` with `size_score` (0‚Äì1), `ai_promotion_suggested` (bool), `promotion_rationale` (string).  
- Add collection `promotion_suggestions` with `{"entity_ref":"type:id","from_type":"task|story|goal","to_type":"task|story|goal","rationale":"string","score":0.0}`.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] Applying a promotion preserves all child links and history.  
- [ ] AI suggestions only auto‚Äëapply if score ‚â• threshold and user enabled auto‚Äëapply.  
- [ ] Undo within 7 days restores original structure.

### 21.2 Priority Engine & Daily Focus (Web + iOS)
**Goal:** Produce a **ranked, actionable focus list** each morning and keep it visible all day.

**Inputs**: due dates, estimates, impact/weighting, persona, health/recovery, calendar availability, blockers, sprint goals, goal deadlines.  
**Outputs**: ranked **Tasks**, recommended **Stories**, highlighted **Goals** (if urgent).  

**UI**
- **Priority Pane** (top of Dashboard):  
  - "Today's Top 5 Tasks" (persona‚Äëscoped) with **why** badges (due soon, high impact, sprint commitment, recovery‚Äëfriendly, short slot filler).  
  - "Story of the Day" (if applicable) with linked tasks.  
  - "Goal at Risk" banner if any goal deadline < N weeks with low progress.  

**Behaviour**
- Recomputes on: day start, changes to health status, added hard blocks, new deadlines.  
- Clicking an item opens **quick schedule** or **go to parent**.  
- Items scheduled receive a **calendar chip** (start‚Äìend).

**Acceptance**
- [ ] Priority list refreshes at 05:30 local or first app open.  
- [ ] Each recommendation includes a machine‚Äëreadable `reason_code` and a human explanation.  
- [ ] Applying a priority schedules a block and updates task due date if empty or misaligned (see 21.4).

---

### 21.3 Automated Sprint Planning (Goal‚ÄëDriven)
**Objective:** Each week, AI proposes a Sprint backlog aligned to **Goal deadlines**, **weights**, and **capacity**.

**Algorithm**
1. Compute **capacity** from availability (hard/soft blocks) minus existing fixed events.  
2. Identify **urgent goals** by deadline proximity and weight (theme targets included).  
3. Choose **candidate stories** that advance urgent goals; enforce WIP and persona constraints.  
4. Decompose into **daily task selections** sized to available slots; propose calendar placements.  
5. Present **Sprint Proposal** (stories + tasks + projected velocity). User **Accept/Amend/Reject**.  
6. On accept: create **Sprint** record, tag chosen stories (`sprint_id`), and place calendar blocks.

**Data**
- `sprints`: `{"id":"string","persona":"personal|work","start_date":"YYYY-MM-DD","end_date":"YYYY-MM-DD","capacity_min":0,"committed_points":0,"created_at":"timestamp"}`  
- `stories.sprint_id` set when included.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] Sprint Proposal includes at least 3 alternatives when feasible (balanced vs aggressive vs conservative).  
- [ ] Accepted sprint populates calendar blocks ‚â§ 5s and updates story/task statuses appropriately.  
- [ ] Burndown available from day 2 (computed points/remaining).

---

### 21.4 Due‚ÄëDate Harmonisation from Scheduling
When the AI schedules a task's first block **after** its current due date, it proposes to **move the due date**; if the task has no due date, it proposes one based on scheduled finish.

**Rules**
- If reschedule pushes completion beyond due date ‚Üí prompt: *"Adjust due date to {new_date}?"*  
- Bulk rule for sprint acceptance: *"Align task due dates to scheduled end times"* toggle.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] No silent due‚Äëdate changes without explicit setting: `auto_align_due_dates=true`.  
- [ ] Change_log captures previous and new due dates with rationale.

---

### 21.5 Daily Priority Digest (Telegram + Email)
**Goal:** Send a morning brief with **Top 5 Tasks**, **Story of the Day**, **Calendar highlights**, and **Goal‚Äëat‚ÄëRisk**.

**Channels**
- **Telegram** via Bot API (user provides bot token + chat_id).  
- **Email** via transactional service (e.g., Firebase Extensions / Mailgun / SendGrid).

**Content**
- Persona‚Äëscoped digests (one per active persona).  
- Sections: Today's Top 5, Story of the Day, Calendar Conflicts, Goal at Risk, Quick Actions (Accept plan, Snooze, Open Planner).  
- Links deep‚Äëlink to Web/iOS views.

**Schedule**
- Default 05:45 local; RRULE configurable; on‚Äëdemand "Send Now".

**Acceptance**
- [ ] Digest sent on schedule with ‚â§60s jitter.  
- [ ] Opt‚Äëout per channel/persona.  
- [ ] Links open the exact filtered view with the recommended item pre‚Äëselected.

**Functions**
- `sendDailyDigest(persona)` ‚Äì assembles content; renders markdown/HTML; sends via Telegram/Email; logs to `digests_log`.

---

### 21.6 iOS & Web ‚Äì Priority & Sprint Views
**iOS**
- **Priority tab** mirrors web Priority Pane; includes *Schedule*, *Done*, *Later* quick actions.  
- **Sprint tab** shows committed stories with progress bars; "Today's slice" task list.

**Web**
- **Priority Pane** (Dashboard) always visible; draggable into Calendar.  
- **Sprint Planner**: compare Proposed vs Current; point capacity; conflict warnings; *Apply* writes calendar blocks.

**Acceptance (UI)**
- [ ] iOS and Web show identical priority ordering given same inputs.  
- [ ] Drag‚Äëto‚Äëcalendar from Priority Pane creates blocks with rationale & due‚Äëdate harmonisation prompt.

---

### 21.7 Non‚Äënegotiable Rule (Re‚Äëassertion)
- **A Story cannot be closed until all linked Tasks are completed.**  
- Server‚Äëside guard remains in place; Planner cannot override.

---

### 21.8 Telemetry & Explainability
- Each recommendation includes (`reason_code`, `weight_breakdown`, `constraints_hit[]`).  
- Expose **"Why this?"** popover: human summary and model signals (e.g., *deadline proximity 0.92, impact 0.76, slot fit 0.88*).

**Acceptance**
- [ ] Every applied recommendation has an attached explanation retrievable from the UI and API.  

---

### 21.9 New/Updated Cloud Functions
- `computePriority(persona)` ‚Äì scores and ranks tasks/stories/goals for today.  
- `proposeSprint(persona, window)` ‚Äì generates sprint candidates from goal deadlines & capacity.  
- `applyPromotion(entity_ref, to_type)` ‚Äì executes promotion/demotion with link migration.  
- `sendDailyDigest(persona)` ‚Äì Telegram/Email.  
- `harmoniseDueDates(task_ids, mode)` ‚Äì aligns due dates to schedule.
